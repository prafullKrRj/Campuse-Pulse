<p id="description">College Time Table and Attendance App.</p>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
College struggles with old-fashioned ways of checking who's in class and planning schedules(Time Tables), leading to mistakes and making it hard for students and teachers to find the info they need. We need a new system that makes attendance and schedules easier for everyone, with all the info readily available online.
<h2>Solution Proposed</h2>
Our solution is an intuitive mobile application designed to address the challenges faced by educational institutions in tracking attendance and managing timetables. 
  -  Teachers can easily record attendance for their classes, while students can view their attendance status and class schedules in real-time. 
  -  Administrators have the ability to manage timetables, add students and branches, and ensure that all information is up-to-date and easily accessible. 
  -  By leveraging technology and providing a user-friendly interface, our app streamlines administrative tasks, improves communication, and enhances overall           efficiency within educational institutions.
